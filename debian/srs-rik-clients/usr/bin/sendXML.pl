=head1 OPTIONS

Options may be either specified directly on the command line, or from a 
configuration file (".rikrc" in the users home directory).

When the same option is specified using both methods, the command-line takes
precedence.  Additionally some options are synonymous with environment
variables, but the command-line still takes precedence - and you shouldn't set
the environment variables as that method is deprecated and may be removed in a 
future release.
